I tried to connect to redis in docker working in docker swarm
Today I failed.
Nevertheless run two instances od spring app in containers and one of redis in container
with docker-compose works
Tomorrow I wll try it again
I try connect with command line from spring container and check the port
I will change the port in application properties
